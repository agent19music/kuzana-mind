"""Aggregate answers for a chat query that is actually about a form question.

retrieval.answer_query's default path finds the single nearest `documents`
chunk. For Tally that chunk is one respondent's whole submission, so "what's
the most common X" or "what's the sentiment on Y" was answered from whichever
one respondent happened to be the closest cosine match to the question, never
the population — even though form_answers/form_themes already hold the real
counts and clustered themes (see their module docstrings).

This module is the missing link: match the query to the form question it's
about (by embedding similarity against `form_questions.embedding`), then build
a plain-text breakdown from SQL aggregates (choice/numeric) or form_themes
(free text) for the LLM to phrase an answer from — grounded in real numbers,
not the wording of one respondent.

Additive: if nothing matches, retrieval falls through to today's document
search unchanged.
